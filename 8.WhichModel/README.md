# Evaluating Regression Models Performance

## R-Squared
Sum of squares of residuals: SSres = SUM(yi - y^i)²
Sum of squares of totlals: SStot = SUM(yi - yAVG)²

R² = 1 - (SSres/SStot)

## Ajusted R-Squared
SSres->min => R² will never decrease
Problem with a third variable for a multiple linear regression model.
